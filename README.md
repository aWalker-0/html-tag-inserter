# html-tag-inserter README
<!-- TODO: Add repository -->
## Features

This is a simple extension which allows you to insert a HTML tag in any text.
This extension's code is originally supplied by [l7ssha's tag-inserter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=l7ssha.tag-inserter) extension. I've updated the original work and made it so it is not bound to HTML documents.

## How To Use

1. First, select the text you want to surround with the tag.
2. You can use either of these way to use the extension:
   * Use the **command pallet** and search for `HTML Tag Inserter`, press enter and type in the tag text.
   * Use the keybinding `ctrl + shift + i`, and type in the tag text.

## Requirements

*None*

## Extension Settings

You can change the keybinding like any other by opening up the keybinding window.
The keybinding's name is `html-tag-inserter.insertTag`.

## Known Issues

*None*
